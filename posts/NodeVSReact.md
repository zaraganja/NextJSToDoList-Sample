Two of the most popular JavaScript technologies for web development are Node JS vs. React JS. However, in terms of the purpose they serve, they are entirely distinct from one another.

React.js is used to create client-side user interfaces and front-end apps, whereas Node.js is a back-end framework.

Furthermore, each of these technologies has its advantages and disadvantages and certain use situations in which they excel.

This article will discuss the fundamental differences between Node JS vs. React JS, their benefits and drawbacks, and why one is preferable to the other.

Brief Introduction of Node JS
Node.js is a free and open-source runtime environment for creating server-side web applications based on JavaScript. To stay lightweight and efficient, it's intended to run asynchronously, with a single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O. 

Ryan Dahl designed it in 2009 to help programmers construct quick and scalable network applications. Because of the numerous advantages it provides to the development table, it is employed by giant corporations and established startups (Netflix, Paypal, NASA, Walmart).

## Key Features of Node JS
Node.js Architecture: Single-Threaded Event Loop Model: The "Single Threaded Event Loop Model" is particularly powerful for handling thousands of concurrent client connections under average online loads, the foundation of Node.js design.
Understanding Node.js and its asynchronous nature: By default, Node.js is asynchronous, which means it does not block. Whenever a customer makes a message to the server, the server creates a single thread to handle the request. 
NodeJS event-driven I/O callback concept: Event-driven programming environment that emphasizes the flow of events. In asynchronous programming, the event-driven idea is related to the callback function. The only distinction is that even the callback function runs after the asynchronous process produces its result, and events are on the event handler.
The Node package manager is essential for Node JS: The Node Package Manager is a package manager for the Node JavaScript runtime environment. It is a component of the Node.js installer. It maintains your project's local dependencies and is the world's largest online repository.

Pros and Cons of Node JS
## Advantages of Node JS
The perfect solution to building a scalable application: Node.js is known as a promising tool for constructing scalable apps. A clustering module in the cross-platform runtime environment helps load balance. Furthermore, Node.js provides a non-blocking event loop architecture that allows servers to operate without interruption.
Node.JS with full-stack Javascript is beneficial for startups: One of the advantages of combining Node.js and full-stack JavaScript is that it speeds up the entire web development process without sacrificing quality. Another advantage of using Node.js with full-stack JS is that you won't need to hire separate front-end and back-end devs. 
## Disadvantages of Node JS
Node.js cannot execute CPU-bound tasks: Node.js cannot do so inside the same event loop when requested to finish a CPU-bound operation. This problem occurs due to JavaScript's single-threaded nature, preventing further actions until a long-running task.
The open and closed source of Node.JS: The open-source nature of Node.js plays a significant part in determining the tool's quality. On the one hand, contributors such as Joyent keep a careful eye on the quality of the Node.js technology. 
Brief Introduction to React JS
React is a JavaScript-based user interface library. Because it is ideal for collecting quickly changing data that has records, React may qualify as a foundation for constructing single-page or mobile apps.

React can also use Node to render on the server and React Native to power mobile apps. One-way reactive data flow follows React, eliminating boilerplate and making it easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

Components in React include lifecycle methods that tell you when they're about to be generated or removed. With a few basic strategies, this understanding may help you optimize your app to be constantly responsive.

Key Features of React JS
Using JSX to create a modern React UI: JavaScript XML is JSX. It improves the readability of code and makes it easier to write. Because browsers do not support JSX, the Babel compiler translates the code to JavaScript. You build elements in JSX in the same manner you do in HTML. 
Learning React.js through Virtual DOM: The most crucial aspect of a web application is the DOM (Document Object Model). It breaks down the code into modules and runs it. JavaScript frameworks often update the entire DOM at once, making the web application sluggish.
Working process of one-way data binding in reacting: The term "one-way data binding" refers to a procedure in which data only flows from top to bottom. Data travels from parent components to child components in this direction. 
Extensions That Will Help You in Using React: React is a JavaScript package that contains helpful user interface components. It comes with several attachments that allow us to construct full-fledged user interface apps. It also allows server-side rendering and mobile app development. Flux, Redux, React Native, and other extensions will enable us to design beautiful user interfaces.

Pros and Cons of React JS
Advantages of React JS
An effective and easy-to-learn Javascript UI library for web development: ReactJS is a popular JavaScript framework with many documentation and tutorials. In only a few days, any developer with a basic understanding of JavaScript can pick up React and start using it. 
Creating a dynamic web application with React JS: React JS is a JavaScript library for developing dynamic web apps. It was difficult to construct an active web application using HTML strings since it required extensive code, but React JS eliminated that problem and made it easy.
Disadvantages of React JS
Developers need to learn new things daily: The rapid speed of progress has both benefits and drawbacks. In the latter instance, the environment is constantly changing, and some engineers are uncomfortable having to relearn new methods to accomplish things frequently. It may be tough for them to absorb all of these changes with all of the constant upgrades. 
ReactJS and the case against JSX: JSX by ReactJS. It's a syntactic extension that lets you blend HTML with JavaScript. Although this method has its advantages, some development community members regard JSX as a barrier, particularly for beginning developers.
