## React Native is the most popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications. This framework has made it possible to create native mobile apps for multiple platforms simultaneously. You can develop full-blown mobile applications for both iOS and Android using a single language, i.e., JavaScript. This is a huge advantage, as it saves a lot of time and money and also eliminates the steep learning curves that are associated with each platform’s native development language (Java or Kotlin for Android, and C or C++ for iOS).

This article will help you get a grip on the basic concepts of React Native. First, we’ll go through the framework’s fundamental aspects. After the basics have been covered, we are going to make our mobile application, a “To-do” app. This application is all about improving productivity as it will allow us to add, manage, and remove tasks. Let’s get started.

What is React Native?
React Native is a JavaScript framework that is used to develop mobile applications for iOS and Android. It lets you build cross-compatible mobile applications using only JavaScript, and you don’t have to worry about learning platform-specific application development languages such as Kotlin for Android or Swift for iOS. 

React Native applications are real mobile applications and not just web applets. Facebook released the first version of React Native in March 2015.

Why Use React Native?
Cross-Platform
One of the most significant advantages of React Native is that you can develop an application for both Android and iOS ecosystems simultaneously by writing the same code with just a few modifications for each platform.
JavaScript
There is no need to know the languages used for platform-specific application development, as React Native uses only JavaScript, probably the most popular programming language right now, for the development of mobile applications. 
Performance
React Native enables speedy development of mobile applications since a similar code is used for applications for both platforms. It also facilitates a hot reloading feature that makes sure that small changes done to the application are immediately visible to the developer.

Large Developers’ Community
A huge developers’ community ensures that all the queries are resolved in time, and therefore, adequate support is available for the React Native framework. 
It Keeps Getting Better
The community, as mentioned above, also keeps updating React Native with new functionalities and making sure that bugs do not occur. 
Used by Many Companies 
Though the framework is relatively new, many companies have already migrated the applications to this framework. Additional companies are looking to use the framework to speed up the process of development and maintenance.

View, State, Props, and Style
View
The View is an elemental component of React Native for building a user interface. It is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, touch handling, and accessibility controls. It maps directly to the native view similar to whatever platform on React Native app is running on.

react-hello

The code inside the “View” block is outputted to the screen


State
There are two types of data that control a component in React Native: props and state. For data that is going to change in the future, we use state. The state contains the data or information about the component. It determines the behavior of the component and how it will render.

import-react

The “state” object contains the data that gets rendered on screen
The “Text” code block renders the state on screen
Props
Props is short for Properties. The components can be customized at the time of creation using different parameters, and those parameters are known as props. Props are passed from one container to another as a means of passing data between them.




In the class “TVshows,” prop is passed to another component called “Watch” 
In the class “Watch,” the received prop is used in the component

Style
React Native uses JavaScript for styling the application. All core components use a prop named “style.” The style names and values are similar to CSS that works for the web. To style our components, we can either use inline styling or use StyleSheet, which is a React Native component.

Inline style is used for the text “inline style” 
Stylesheet object is created to style the texts, “blue” and “bigBlack”
